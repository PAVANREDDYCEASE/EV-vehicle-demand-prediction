# EV-vehicle-demand-prediction
🚗 EV Vehicle/Charging Demand Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) using real-world registration data. Accurate predictions help urban planners and government bodies to better prepare infrastructure—especially EV charging stations—thereby supporting sustainability goals.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL), and it records the number of registered electric and non-electric vehicles by county, date, and type of use.

🎯 Objective
To build a regression model that can forecast future EV adoption by analyzing:

EV growth trends over time

Types of EVs (BEVs vs. PHEVs)

Geographic and usage-based features

📁 Week 1 Deliverables
